                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that simpler is often better for many UI purposes. A lot of the designs were minimalistic, relying on pastels and netural colors to complement the white. Keeping the interface clean and harmonic enables the user to know what the page entails and what they should do next. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was the variety of devices that the designs were created for. From mobile to PC, eacn design choice is impactful and considerate of the limitations of each device, pandering to window size and action possibilities. Every animation, button, and text size has a purpose and an acccessibility challenge to meet, which every app approached differently </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite interaction was the easygrow.io app previeew by Edmond Vasar for ELEMENTS. The light colors used are very pleasing to the eye and give a friendly, almost cute energy to these vegetables that are traditionally not associated with that mood. The text and icons and still quite readable despite the light coloring, in a very complementary manner. Furthermore, the rounded edges of all the boxes and icon contribute to the app's disarmingly sweet charm - it's giving fun and fresh. </p>

                            <p> 6,  I enjoyed the visual animations but I wish there a little more explanation of certain design choices and why they worked well.</p>
