					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are helpful guidelines in place to determine how accessible a website is. For example, I learned that a good rule of thumb is that background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1. This is helpful to reference when designing visuals, so that my content is easily visible to everyone. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when the author listed helpful websites and references to look at for inspiration and advice. For example, they suggested Colorable and Colorsafe to look at contrast levels. These tools are now bookmarked so I can use them while designing my midterm project. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Accounting for accessibility early on in a product’s life cycle is best—it reduces the time and money you’ll spend to make your products accessible retroactively. Color accessibility requires a little up-front work when selecting your product’s color palette, but ensuring your colors are accessible will pay dividends down the road." </p>
						</li>
