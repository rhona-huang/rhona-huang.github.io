        Hi, my name is Rhona and I like video games, reading, and playing with cats. I've hit gold in Valorant and plat in TFT, but I kinda fell off after CS classes started getting really hard. I'm trying to start hitting the gym but quite frankly there's too many people and I get scared of crowds.

            My favorite part of the article is when the author broke down the individual apps like Airbnb, Twitter etc. It helped me notice small details I never noticed before, like how placeholder texts serve a purpose or how spotify playlists have different subheaders.

            I'd rate this a 7, concise but conveys a lot of information.
