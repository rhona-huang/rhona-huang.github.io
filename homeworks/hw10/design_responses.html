							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think this article taught me a lot of points to consider when designing a user interface. For example, I should utilize the cocktail party effect to emphasize a certain point on a website. Furthermore, I should be wary of having too many options, as it has a tradeoff regarding user attention span. If I offer more options the design will be more comprehensive, but I risk losing the user's attention as it uses more cognitive overload to think about these decisions. </p>
