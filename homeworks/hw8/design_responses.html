				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that dark patterns are a misleading UI chocie that takes advantage of users through human psychology. Part of it works because humans do not read every word on a page, constantly missing important details. There are many different types of dark patterns, such as bait and switch, disguised ads, etc. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was when the author explained the dark patterns in detail and how to spot them. This is very useful in my own life, where I spend a lot of time online and could end up being a victim. For example, in disguised ads, ads appear to be part of the original page and makes users click on them more - something I could easily do by accident.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> " Dark patterns, on the other hand, are not mistakes. They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
