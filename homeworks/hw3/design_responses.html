							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that audience is important to choosing font. One should use extremely legible fonts with clear shapes for children, and readable size fonts with visually clear stylization for seniors. I also learned that using font type and pairings in a harmonic way is crucial to the readability of a page. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was looking at all the links they provided to other useful websites for design. I spent a few minutes looking at typewolf, which was super visually pleasing and had great lists of recommended fonts. I also really liked the Chrome extension recommendation of WhatTheFont; I'm excited to try it out since I see a lot of interesting fonts on websites I browse. </p>
