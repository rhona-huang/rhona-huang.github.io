					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the Gestalt principles, which help us understand the links between visual design and psychology. The theory behind it is that the whole is perceived and more than the sum of its components. The principles are built on the four ideas of emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the explanation of modern day application of the Gestalt principles. I liked learning how these perceptions have changed throughout history, but are still relevant today. These principle use psychology to inform UI choices that are better for humans - super cool! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Regardless of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they might appear, if they are moving or changing together, they are perceived as related. This effect can take place even when movement is implied, by other visual elements." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
